Biologically men have only one innate orientationa sexual one that draws them to womenwhile women have two innate orientations sexual toward men and reproductive toward their young  I was a woman terribly vulnerable critical using femaleness as a sort of standard of yardstick to measure and discard men Yessomething like that I was an Anna who invited defeat from men without ever being conscious of it But I am conscious of it And being conscious of it means I shall leave it all behind me and becomebut what I was stuck fast in an emotion common to women of our time that can turn them bitter or Lesbian or solitary Yes that Anna during that time was     The bias of compulsory heterosexuality through which lesbian experience is perceived on a scale ranging from deviant to abhorrent or simply rendered invisible could be illustrated from many other texts than the two just preceding The assumption made by Rossi that women are innately sexually oriented toward men or by Lessing that the lesbian choice is simply an actingout of bitterness toward men are by no means theirs alone they are widely current in literature and in the social sciencesI am concerned here with two other matters as well first how and why womens choice of women as passionate comrades life partners coworkers lovers tribe has been crushed invalidated forced into hiding and disguise and second the virtual or total neglect of lesbian existence in a wide range of writings Including feminist scholarship Obviously there is a connection here I believe that much feminist theory and criticism is stranded on this shoalMy organizing impulse is the belief that it is not enough for feminist thought that specifically lesbian texts exist Any theory or culturalpolitical creation that treats lesbian existence as a marginal or less natural phenomenon as mere sexual preference or as the mirror image of either heterosexual or male homosexual relations is profoundly weakened thereby whatever its other contributions Feminist theory can no longer afford merely to voice a toleration of lesbianism as an alternative lifestyle or make token allusion to lesbians A feminist critique of compulsory heterosexual orientation for women is long overdue In this exploratory paper I shall try to show whyI will begin by way of examples briefly discussing four books that have appeared in the last few years written from different viewpoints and political orientations but all presenting themselves and favorably reviewed as feminist All take as a basic assumption that the social relations of the sexes are disordered and extremely problematic if not disabling for women all seek paths toward change I have learned more from some of these books than from others but on this I am clear each one might have been more accurate more powerful more truly a force for change had the author felt impelled to deal with lesbian existence as a reality and as a source of knowledge and power available to women or with the institution of heterosexuality itself as a beachhead of male dominance In none of them is the question ever raised whether in a different context or other things being equal women would choose heterosexual coupling and marriage heterosexuality is presumed as a sexual preference of most women either implicitly or explicitly In none of these books which concern themselves with mothering sex roles relationships and societal prescriptions for women is compulsory heterosexuality ever examined as an institution powerfully affecting all these or the idea of preference or innate orientation even indirectly questionedIn For Her Own Good  Years of the Experts Advice to Women by Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English the authors superb pamphlets Witches Midwives and Nurses A History of Women Healers and Complaints and Disorders The Sexual Politics of Sickness are developed into a provocative and complex study Their thesis in this book is that the advice given American women by male health professionals particularly in the areas of marital sex maternity and child care has echoed the dictates of the economic marketplace and the role capitalism has needed women to play in production and or reproduction Women have become the consumer victims of various cures therapies and normative judgments in different periods including the prescription to middleclass women to embody and preserve the sacredness of the homethe scientific romanticization of the home itself None of the experts  advice has been either particularly scientific or womenoriented it has reflected male needs male fantasies about women and male interest in controlling womenparticularly in the realms of sexuality and motherhoodfused with the requirements of industrial capitalism So much of this book is so devastatingly informative and is written with such lucid feminist wit that I kept waiting as I read for the basic prescription against lesbianism to he examined It never wasThis can hardly be for lack of information Jonathan Katzs Gay American History tells us that as early as  the New Haven Colony prescribed the death penalty for lesbians Katz provides many suggestive and informative documents on the treatment or torture of lesbians by the medical profession in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries Recent work by the historian Nancy Sahli documents the crackdown on intense female friendships among college women at the turn of the present century The ironic title For Her Own Good might have referred first and foremost to the economic imperative to heterosexuality and marriage and to the sanctions imposed against single women and widowsboth of whom have been and still are viewed as deviant Yet in this often enlightening Marxistfeminist overview of male prescriptions for female sanity and health the economics of prescriptive heterosexuality go unexaminedOf the three psychoanalytically based books one Jean Baker Millers Toward a New Psychology of Women is written as if Lesbians simply do not exist even as marginal beings Given Millers title I find this astonishing However the favorable reviews the book has received in feminist journals including Signs and Spokeswoman suggest that Millers heterocentric assumptions are widely shared In The Mermaid and the Minotaur Sexual Arrangements and the Human Malaise Dorothy Dinnerstein makes an impassioned argument for the sharing of parenting between women and men and for an end to what she perceives as the malefemale symbiosis of gender arrangements which she feels are leading the species further and further into violence and selfextinction Apart from other problems that I have with this book including her silence on the institutional and random terrorism men have practiced on womenand childrenthroughout history amply documented by Barry Daly Griffin Russell and van de Ven and Brownmiller  and her obsession with psychology to the neglect of economic and other material realities that help to create psychological reality I find utterly a historical Dinnersteins view of the relations between women and men as a collaboration to keep history mad She means by this to perpetuate social relations that are hostile exploitative and destructive to life itself She sees women and men as equal partners in the making of sexual arrangements seemingly unaware of the repeated struggles of women to resist oppression our own and that of others and to change our condition She ignores specifically the history of women who as witches femmes seules marriage resisters spinsters autonomous widows andor lesbianshave managed on varying levels not to collaborate It is this history precisely from which feminists have so much to learn and on which there is overall such blanketing silence Dinnerstein acknowledges at the end of her book that female separatism though not on a large scale and in the long run wildly impractical has something to teach us Separate women could in principle set out to learn from scratchundeflected by the opportunities to evade this task that mens presence has so far offeredwhat intact selfcreative humanness is  Phrases like intact selfcreative humanness obscure the question of what the many forms of female separatism have actually been addressing The fact is that women in every culture and throughout history have undertaken the task of independent nonheterosexual womanconnected existence to the extent made possible by their context often in the belief that they were the only ones ever to have done so They have undertaken it even though few women have been in an economic position to resist marriage altogether and even though attacks against unmarried women have ranged from aspersion and mockery to deliberate gynocide including the burning and torturing of millions of widows and spinsters during the witch persecutions of the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe and the practice of suttee on widows in IndiaNancy Chodorow does come close to the edge of an acknowledgment of lesbian existence Like Dinnerstein Chodorow believes that the fact that women and women only are responsible for child care in the sexual division of labor has led to an entire social organization of gender inequality and that men as well as women must become primary carers for children if that inequality is to change In the process of examining from a psychoanalytic perspective how motheringbywomen affects the psychological development of girl and boy children she offers documentation that men are emotionally secondary in womens lives that women have a richer ongoing inner world to fall back on    men do not become as emotionally important to women as women do to men   This would carry into the late twentieth century SmithRosenbergs findings about eighteenth and nineteenthcentury womens emotional focus on women Emotionally important can of course refer to anger as well as to love or to that intense mixture of the two often found in womens relationships with women one aspect of what I have come to call the doublelife of women see below Chodorow concludes that because women have women as mothers The mother remains a primary internal object sic to the girl so that heterosexual relationships are on the model of a nonexclusive second relationship for her whereas for the boy they recreate an exclusive primary relationship  According to Chodorow women have learned to deny the limitations of masculine lovers for both psychological and practical reasonsBut the practical reasons like witch burnings male control of law theology and science or economic nonviability within the sexual division of labor are glossed over Chodorows account barely glances at the constraints and sanctions that historically have enforced or ensured the coupling of women with men and obstructed or penalized our coupling or allying in independent groups with other women She dismisses lesbian existence with the comment that lesbian relationships do tend to recreate motherdaughter emotions and connections but most women are heterosexual implied more mature having developed beyond the motherdaughter connection She then adds This heterosexual preference and taboos on homosexuality in addition to objective economic dependence on men make the option of primary sexual bonds with other women unlikelythough more prevalent in recent years  The significance of that qualification seems irresistiblebut Chodorow does not explore it further Is she saying that lesbian existence has become more visible in recent years in certain groups that economic and other pressures have changed under capitalism socialism or both and that consequently more women are rejecting the heterosexual choice She argues that women want children because their heterosexual relationships lack richness and intensity that in having a child a woman seeks to recreate her own intense relationship with her mother It seems to be that on the basis of her own findings Chodorow leads us implicitly to conclude that heterosexuality is not a preference for women that for one thing it fragments the erotic from the emotional in a way that women find impoverishing and painful Yet her book participates in mandating it Neglecting the covert socializations and the overt forces that have channeled women into marriage and heterosexual romance pressures ranging from the selling of daughters to postindustrial economics to the silences of literature to the images of the television screen she like Dinnerstein is stuck with trying to reform a manmade institutioncompulsory heterosexualityas if despite profound emotional impulses and complementarities drawing women toward women there is a mysticalbiological heterosexual inclination a preference or choice that draws women toward menMoreover it is understood that this preference does not need to be explained unless through the tortuous theory of the female Oedipus complex or the necessity for species reproduction It is lesbian sexuality that usually and incorrectly included under male homosexuality is seen as requiring explanation This assumption of female heterosexuality seems to me in itself remarkable it is an enormous assumption to have glided so silently into the foundations of our thought"
